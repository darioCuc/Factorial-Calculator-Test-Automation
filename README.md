# Factorial Calculator Test Automation

This project includes a script designed to automate the testing of an online factorial calculator, specifically focusing on its accuracy for calculating the factorial of integer numbers in the range of 10 to 100. The primary goal of this script is to ensure that the calculator provides correct and reliable results across the specified range, catering to the needs of users who require precise mathematical computations.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Playwright
- A code editor (e.g., VSCode)

### Installing

## Built With

- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - The web testing and automation library used for creating end-to-end tests.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - The programming language used to write the test scripts, offering type safety and modern JavaScript features.


### Scope of the Test

The test script executes a series of automated checks on the calculator's web interface, inputting integer values from 10 to 100 and comparing the calculator's output against expected factorial results. This range was chosen to cover a broad spectrum of use cases while also ensuring that the calculations remain within a manageable computational complexity for web-based tools.


### Testing Documentation

All relevant documentation for our testing tasks, including detailed test plans, expected outcomes, comprehensive reports, and visual evidence of the testing process, are available in the `testing-documentation` folder. This repository serves as a centralized location for all materials related to the testing of the online factorial calculator and the Avalanche crypto faucet, ensuring transparency and accessibility for stakeholders.
